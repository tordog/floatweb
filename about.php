			<h1>ABOUT</h1>
			<p>Float is an undergraduate organization that aims to bring more women interested in technology and entrepreneurship into the Yale community. 
				However, anyone is welcome to participate in its programs. It provides various student-run workshops to anyone interested, 
				as well as a mentoring program to those considering the Computer Science major. All workshops and events are presented free-of-charge. <br><br> As 
				Float expands, we are eager to create and host more workshops, and send our members to conferences and hackathons. If you are interested in 
				contributing or want to learn more, please <a href="./mailchimp_signup.php">sign up for the Float mailing list</a>, or email team@floatyale.com.</p>
