			<h2>What does Float do?</h2>

			<p>Float is an undergraduate organization that aims to bring more girls interested in technology 
			and entrepreneurship into the Yale community. However, anyone is welcome to participate in its programs. 
			It provides student-run workshops in web development and design to anyone interested in learning and a mentoring 
			program to those considering the Computer Science major. All workshops and events are presented free-of-charge.
			To learn more, please <a href="./mailchimp_signup.php">sign up for the Float mailing list</a>, or email team@floatyale.com.</p>

			<h2>Who can sign up for classes?</h2>

			<p>Anyone at Yale interested in learning can sign up! You DO NOT need any previous programming experience nor do 
			you need to be a Computer Science major.</p>


			<h2>Why was Float created?</h2>

			<p>Learning to code is frustrating. Most of us at Float didn't start programming until college so we know how 
			hard it is to pick up without any outside help. Our goal is to reach any struggling student who wants to learn 
			how to become better at coding, but needs help to reach the next level. Through our workshops and programs, we're 
			aiming to encourage more students to give Computer Science a chance and hoping they'll like it as much as we do.</p>


			<h2>Float seems awesome! I'm interested in becoming a part of the team. How can I get more involved?</h2>

			<p>If you're interested in joining us, please email team@floatyale.com and explain how you would like to get involved. 
			Becoming a part of the team comes with many benefits including priority access to events and free swag (think Float neon tanks).</p>
