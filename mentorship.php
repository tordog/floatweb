			<h2>Mentorship Program </h2>
			<p>Float is starting a new mentorship program for potential/decided Computer Science majors and anyone else
			 taking a CS class this semester. <br><br>

			The goal of this program is not only for mentees to gain advice and perspective from his/her mentor, but also 
			for other mentees taking the same CS classes to meet one another. The program is low-commitment, with several
			meet-ups throughout the year. <br><br>

			To sign up for Fall 2014's mentorship program, please email team@floatyale.com.</p>
